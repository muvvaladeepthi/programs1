Second Hand Car purchase
------------------------

Do

1. I will manually enquire about the cars with mechanics,vendors and relatives

2. I will search in google for best resale car

3. I will ask some of the car owners about their exp with the selected car


Feels

1. Frustrated in enquiring with diff modes

Say

I am not driver then how do I test my car
I don't have funds is there any way to get finance

Thought

I want a car in budget less than 2L
I want to purchase a car in the next 2 days / 2 weeks

Software Engineering by Roger S Pressman


Characteristics of Software:

1. Software is developed or engineered; 
   it is not manufactured in the classical sense

2. Software doesn’t “wear out.”

3. Although the industry is moving toward component-based construction, 
  most software continues to be custom built.

4. 

Software engineering
encompasses a
process, methods for
managing and
engineering software,
and tools.


A process is a collection of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when
some work product is to be created.


A generic process framework for software engineering
encompasses five activities:


1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Coding
4. Testing
5. Implementation


1. Communication
2. Planning
3. Modeling
4. Construction
5. Deployment


Feasibility Study

1. Technical Feasibility
2. Operational Fesability
3. Financial Feasibiltiy
