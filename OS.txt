Operating System
----------------

It is the interface or bridge between the hardware and user

types of OS

1. Single User and Single Task OS --> MS DOS
2. Single User and Multitask OS-----> Windows
3. Multi User Operating System -----> Linux, Rhel, Mac, Ubuntu
4. Network Operating System
5. Distributed Operating System
6. Embedded Operating System


Responsibilities of OS
----------------------

1. Process Management --- 
2. Memory Management
3.File Management
4. Device Management
5. User Management
6. Security


Features of Linux Operating
--------------------------
It is the oldest OS ---> 1960's
1991 ---> Standard Format of Linux / Commerical linux released developed and mantained
 by GPL (General Public License)

1 Generation --- Vaccum Tubes
2 Generation ---> Transistor
3 Generation --> IC's---> high level programing lang came into existence
4. Generation ---> IC's and circuits
5. Generation --> Data
6. Generation--> AI

Features of Linux Operating System Architecture
-----------------------------------------------

1. Open Source

2. Stability and Reliability

3. Customizability

4. Security

5. Scalability ( increasing or decreasing the machines on demand)

6. CLI  (Command Line Interface)

Linux Distribution
------------------
1. Ubuntu
2. Debian
3. RHEL
4. Fedora
5. CentOS


Different Components of Linux Operating System Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Kernel 
    It is the central part of linux which will manages the hardward
    Memory Management, Process scheduling, networking

2. System Libraries
   C - Lang (gLibc)-- c standard library
   C++ lib support

3. System Utilities

  
Shell-----> Is a small command line interpreter that allows users to interact with  
              OS

  Core Utilities --Linux distributions come with a set of core utilities for managing files, processes, users, and system configurations. Examples include ls, cp, mv, rm, ps, grep, and systemctl.


  Package Management --  update, modify or delete the software packages required by linux

ex> yum (yellowdog updater, Modifier) 

4. File System

   Hierarchical File System  ---> where data is arranged in the form of a tree

   root ---> elements ---> sub elements

Diff formats for file system are:

NTFS --(
ext4
XFS
Brtfs 


5. User Interace 

  CLI
  GUI

6. Device Drivers
    kernal Modules
    Loadable Kernal Modules
    

7. Networking
    default Network Stack
    Default network configuration
    TCP/IP, IPv4 and IPv6, UDP, 

8. Security
    It will mandate creation of users to access the system
     User Permissions 
    Firewalls and security Tools


9. Virtual Memory Management

10. System Intialization
    Boot loader
    Init System
