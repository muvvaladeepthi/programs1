Disadvantages or limitations
----------------------------

1. Total Presentation and bussiness logic are merged together

2. Data and Presentation are meged, if we change the data, then we need to
   change the presentation

3. Presentation canot be directly written with html, it should be give
   with java based code only.

4. There is no clear implemntation for MVC arch

Model
View
Controller

5. There are no implicit objects 

6. Exception handling is also difficult


RequestDispatcher ---> can forward the requests from one servlet to anther servlet

include---> will incldue all the data in the same servlet
forward--->forwards the request to another servlet along with data



JSP
---
Extension to Servlet -- JSP

Java Server Pages

JSP is a server side web component written in Java, used to create the dynamic web
pages

in jsp presentations can be written directly by using html tags



Servlet and JSP to clearly seperate the Bussiness Logic with Presentation
and Presentation with data


9 Implicit Objects in JSP

request, response, out, exception, session, config, page,pageContext, application



JSP has its own lifecycle
--------------------------

compilation-- compile the jsp code and converts into a servlet

intialization---> intialize the jsp by calling a method jspInit()


execution----> _jspService()

cleaup or destroy ---> jspDestroy()


Jsp Code consists  diff types
-----------------------------

jsp scripting elements ---> diff types of code to write the jsp pages

Scriplets -- these are used to execute / represent any valid java code
<%   %>

expressions  -- These tages are used to evaluate any java expression
<% String name = "praveen"; %>
<%=name%>
<%=4+10%>

declartions  -- These tags are used to declare variables, methods, or any java
valid declarations
<% !

int x;
String  name;
public int cube(int x){

	return x*x*x;
}


 %>



all the jsp code is written in tags

directives--> jsp directives are messages that tells the web container how to translate
the jsp page into a corresponding servlet

<%@    %>

scriptlet --> <%    %>---> Write any valid java code
expressions-> <%=   %>---->Evaluate any java expression
declarations-> <%!  %>-----> Declare any java declarations
directives---> <%@  %>-----> message to container about the conversion of servlet
   1.1 page ---> defines the attributes that need to apply for entire page
         import
	 contentType
	 extends
	 info
	 buffer
	language
	isErrorPage
	errorPage
	isThreadSafe=true (Mulithreading ) 
	session -- used to implement the session management

   1.2 include  ---> Is used to include the output of file in the current page
	<@include file="header.html" %>

   1.3 taglib ---> used to define a tag library that defines many tags
       <@taglib uri="http://www.myjsptags.com/tags" prefix="mytag" %>

	<%=http://www.jsptags.com/tags/currentDate %>
	<mytag:currentDate/>
